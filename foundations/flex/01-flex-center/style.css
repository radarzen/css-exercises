/* REFLECTIONS:  This was a simple exercise, but I realize I still have to 
    use notes to remember the exact verbiage for the properties.  VS Code's
    auto-fill really helps. I got a lot out of the one website that really
    broke down the concept between "content" along the main axis.  That
    helps me remember which properties to use.  The css-poster is super
    helpful too.
