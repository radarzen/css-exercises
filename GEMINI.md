# Project Context: Learning HTML & CSS

This project is designed to teach you the fundamentals of HTML and CSS through a series of exercises. Your goal is to work through each exercise and implement the styles and structures required to achieve the desired outcome.

## How to use Gemini CLI for learning:

When you encounter challenges or have questions while working on the exercises, please use the `instructor` skill. This skill is specifically designed to:

*   **Generate Explanations:** Help you understand HTML and CSS concepts, properties, or selectors.
*   **Provide Coding Advice and Best Practices:** Offer guidance on writing clean, efficient, and semantic code.
*   **Offer Examples (without solutions):** Provide illustrative code snippets or scenarios that demonstrate a concept, encouraging you to apply the knowledge yourself.

**Crucially, I will not provide direct solutions to your exercises.** My role is to guide you towards understanding the concepts so you can figure out the solutions on your own, fostering a deeper learning experience.

## Coding Style and Conventions:

Refer to the examples provided within the `solution/` folders of each exercise for guidance on the expected coding style, formatting, and general conventions. Aim to replicate the approach and aesthetic demonstrated in these solutions.

Let's begin your journey into HTML and CSS!
